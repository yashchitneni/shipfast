# Market UI Improvements

## Summary
Fixed the market trading UI to prevent errors when trying to sell items you don't own, and ensured inventory quantities update properly after transactions.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Sell Button Disabled When Item Not Owned
**Problem**: Players could click "Sell" for items they didn't own, causing errors
**Solution**: 
- Added inventory tracking in MarketTradingPanel
- Sell button is now disabled when:
  - Player doesn't own the item
  - Player owns fewer units than they're trying to sell
- Added helpful tooltips explaining why the button is disabled

### 2. Inventory Quantity Display
**Problem**: Players couldn't see how many units they owned while trading
**Solution**:
- Added "You own: X units" display next to the Trade Quantity input
- Shows real-time inventory status for the selected item
- Updates automatically after buy/sell transactions

### 3. Inventory Not Updating After Transactions
**Problem**: "You own: X units" indicators didn't update after buying/selling
**Solution**:
- Created transaction event system in market store
- Added `onTransactionComplete` callback system
- Both InventorySection and InventoryStatus components now listen for transaction events
- All inventory displays update automatically after any buy/sell operation

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified

1. **app/store/useMarketStore.ts**
   - Added `transactionListeners` array
   - Added `onTransactionComplete()` method for subscribing to events
   - Added `notifyTransactionComplete()` method
   - Updated buy/sell methods to trigger transaction events

2. **app/components/market/MarketTradingPanel.tsx**
   - Added `playerInventory` state to track owned items
   - Added `loadPlayerInventory()` function
   - Subscribe to transaction events for automatic updates
   - Disabled sell button based on inventory status
   - Added inventory quantity display in trade UI

3. **app/components/market/InventoryStatus.tsx**
   - Subscribe to transaction events
   - Automatically refresh when transactions complete

4. **app/components/inventory/InventorySection.tsx**
   - Subscribe to transaction events
   - Removed annoying 5-second refresh
   - Updates only when needed
