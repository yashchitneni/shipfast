# Phase 2 Systems Integration Documentation

## Overview

This document describes the integration of Phase 2 systems (Routes, Economy, Market, and AI Companion) into the main Flexport Tycoon game.

## Integrated Systems

### 1. Route System (`useRouteStore`)
- **Purpose**: Manages trade routes between ports
- **Features**:
  - Create, update, and delete routes
  - Route profitability calculations
  - Route state tracking (idle, in_transit, completed)
  - Visual route rendering on game canvas
  - Route optimization suggestions

### 2. Economy System (`useEconomyStore`)
- **Purpose**: Handles player financials and economic calculations
- **Features**:
  - Player cash and credit management
  - Route profit calculations
  - Loan system with credit ratings
  - Monthly financial tracking
  - Economic modifiers and bonuses

### 3. Market System (`useMarketStore`)
- **Purpose**: Dynamic goods pricing and trading
- **Features**:
  - Real-time price updates
  - Supply and demand simulation
  - Market volatility
  - Buy/sell transactions
  - Price history tracking

### 4. AI Companion System (`useAIStore`)
- **Purpose**: Intelligent assistant that learns from player actions
- **Features**:
  - Route pattern learning
  - Market insights and predictions
  - Suggestion generation
  - Experience and leveling system
  - Performance tracking

## Integration Architecture

### Central Integration Module
The `SystemIntegration` class (`app/lib/game/system-integration.ts`) coordinates all Phase 2 systems:

```typescript
// Initialize all systems
await systemIntegration.initialize(playerId);

// Check system status
const status = systemIntegration.getStatus();

// Cleanup when done
systemIntegration.cleanup();
```

### System Connections

1. **Route → Economy**:
   - Route completions generate revenue
   - Profitability calculations use economy modifiers
   - Financial transactions are recorded

2. **Market → Economy**:
   - Market transactions update player cash
   - Market conditions affect route profitability
   - Price volatility impacts economy state

3. **AI → All Systems**:
   - Learns from route completions
   - Analyzes market price changes
   - Generates suggestions based on all data
   - Gains experience from player actions

4. **Route → Canvas**:
   - Routes are visualized on the game map
   - Asset movement along routes is animated
   - Route colors indicate profitability

## UI Components

### New UI Panels
1. **RouteManager** - Create and manage trade routes
2. **MarketTradingPanel** - Buy/sell goods
3. **FinancialDashboard** - View financial metrics
4. **AICompanionPanel** - Interact with AI assistant

### Game UI Integration
All panels are accessible through the bottom navigation bar in the game UI.

## Database Schema

### New Tables
- `routes` - Trade route definitions
- `route_performance` - Historical route data
- `market_items` - Goods and pricing
- `market_transactions` - Trade history
- `ai_companions` - AI state and progress
- `ai_suggestions` - Generated suggestions
- `ai_learning_events` - Learning history

## Testing

Run the integration test:
```bash
npx tsx scripts/test-phase2-integration.ts
```

This will:
1. Initialize all systems
2. Create test routes
3. Simulate market transactions
4. Test system connections
5. Verify revenue generation

## Development Access

In development mode, all stores and the integration module are exposed on the window object:
```javascript
// Access stores
window.useRouteStore
window.useEconomyStore
window.useMarketStore
window.useAIStore
window.systemIntegration

// Check system status
window.systemIntegration.getStatus()
```

## Performance Considerations

- Route rendering updates at 10 FPS to reduce overhead
- Market prices update every 60 seconds
- AI suggestions generate every 30 seconds
- All systems use subscription-based updates for efficiency

## Future Enhancements

1. **Advanced AI Features**:
   - Disaster prediction
   - Fleet optimization
   - Market manipulation detection

2. **Complex Routes**:
   - Multi-modal transportation
   - Route branching
   - Dynamic waypoints

3. **Economic Events**:
   - Global market crashes
   - Trade embargos
   - Currency fluctuations

4. **Multiplayer Integration**:
   - Shared markets
   - Route competition
   - Economic warfare
