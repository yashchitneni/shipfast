# Market Trading Error Handling Improvements

## Problem
The user reported that when they try to sell items without inventory, an alert message blocks the entire market UI, preventing them from seeing market items or prices.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Non-Blocking Toast Notifications
- Created a new Toast component (`app/components/ui/Toast.tsx`) that displays non-blocking notifications
- Toast messages appear in the bottom-right corner and auto-dismiss after 5 seconds
- Supports success, error, warning, and info message types
- Multiple toasts stack vertically

### 2. Inline Error Display
- Added inline error display in the trading panel that shows errors below the total cost
- Errors are displayed with a red background and warning icon
- Error messages clear when selecting a new item

### 3. Inventory Status Indicators
- Created InventoryStatus component that shows "You own: X units" for each market item
- Displays in green when player has inventory, gray when they don't
- Updates in real-time as inventory changes

### 4. UI Improvements
- Added tooltip to sell button explaining its purpose
- Removed blocking alert() calls throughout the trading flow
- All errors now use toast notifications or inline display
