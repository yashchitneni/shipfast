# State Management Analysis - Market Trading

## Current Problems

### 1. Mixed State Sources
- **Client State**: Market items, supply/demand, transactions
- **Server State**: Player inventory, actual ownership
- **Issue**: They're not properly synced

### 2. Update Flow Issues
When you buy/sell:
1. Server updates `player_inventory` table ✅
2. Client updates local market supply/demand ✅
3. Client notifies listeners ✅
4. **BUT**: Inventory components don't know what changed ❌
5. **Result**: "You own: X units" doesn't update

### 3. No Transaction Feedback
- When buying, no loading state
- No indication transaction is processing
- Success only shown via toast

## Proposed Solution

### Server as Single Source of Truth
1. **Transaction Flow**:
   ```
   User clicks Buy/Sell
   → Show loading state
   → Send to server
   → Server updates database
   → Client fetches fresh data
   → Update all UI components
   ```

2. **State Management**:
   - Server: Owns all persistent data
   - Client: Only caches for display
   - After any mutation: Refetch from server

3. **Optimistic Updates** (Optional):
   - Show immediate UI change
   - Rollback if server fails
   - Better perceived performance

### Implementation Plan

1. **Add Loading States**:
   - Disable buttons during transaction
   - Show spinner on active button
   - Prevent double-clicks

2. **Fix Data Flow**:
   - After buy/sell, fetch fresh inventory
   - Update all displays from server data
   - Don't rely on manual state updates

3. **Better Feedback**:
   - Show "Processing..." during transaction
   - Clear success/error states
   - Update inventory numbers from server
