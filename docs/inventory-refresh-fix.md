# Inventory Refresh Fix

## Problem
The inventory panel was constantly showing "Loading inventory..." every 5 seconds, which was annoying and disrupted the user experience.

## Root Cause
In `InventorySection.tsx`, there was a `setInterval` that reloaded inventory every 5 seconds to show updated profit calculations when market prices changed.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Removed the 5-second interval
- Deleted the `setInterval(loadInventory, 5000)` code
- Inventory now loads only once when the component mounts

### 2. Added Event-Based Updates
Created a transaction event system in the market store:
- Added `transactionListeners` array to store callbacks
- Added `onTransactionComplete()` method to subscribe to transaction events
- Added `notifyTransactionComplete()` method to trigger callbacks
- Updated `buyItem()` and `sellItem()` to call `notifyTransactionComplete()` after successful transactions

### 3. Smart Price Updates
- Inventory profit calculations update when market prices change
- This happens without showing "Loading..." - just updates the numbers
- Uses a separate `useEffect` that watches `marketItems` changes

## How It Works Now

1. **Initial Load**: Inventory loads once when you open the market panel
2. **After Trading**: Inventory automatically reloads after you buy or sell items
3. **Price Changes**: Profit calculations update in real-time when market prices change (no loading state)
4. **No Polling**: No more constant refresh every 5 seconds

## Benefits

- ✅ No more annoying "Loading inventory..." flashing
- ✅ Inventory updates only when needed
- ✅ Better performance (fewer database queries)
- ✅ Smoother user experience
- ✅ Real-time profit updates without reload

## Files Modified

1. **app/components/inventory/InventorySection.tsx**
   - Removed 5-second interval
   - Added transaction event subscription
   - Split inventory loading and price update logic

2. **app/store/useMarketStore.ts**
   - Added `transactionListeners` array
   - Added `onTransactionComplete()` and `notifyTransactionComplete()` methods
   - Updated `buyItem()` and `sellItem()` to trigger events

## Testing

1. Open the market panel - inventory loads once
2. Buy an item - inventory updates automatically
3. Sell an item - inventory updates automatically
4. Wait for price changes - profit calculations update without "Loading..."
5. No more constant refreshing!
