# Implementation Status

**Current Status:** Phase 2.0 - Critical Integration Required  
**Last Updated:** January 2025  
**Priority:** 🔴 URGENT - Must fix before adding features

## 🚨 Critical Issue

UI components are built but disconnected from live data stores. They're using mock data instead of the Zustand stores. **No new features can be added until this integration is complete.**

## Implementation Status Legend

- ✅ **Fully Implemented & Working**
- 🟡 **Schema/Store Exists (No Integration)**  
- 🔴 **Not Implemented**
- 🚧 **Placeholder/Mock Data Only**

## 🎯 Phase 2.0: Critical Integration Tasks

**Duration:** 2-3 weeks  
**Status:** Not Started  
**Blockers:** Must complete before ANY new features

### Task 2.0.1: Connect MarketTradingPanel (🔴 Critical)
**Duration:** 2-3 days

**Current Issue:**
```typescript
// PROBLEM: Using mock data
const MOCK_MARKET_ITEMS = [...];
```

**Required Fix:**
```typescript
// SOLUTION: Use real store
import { useMarketStore } from '@/store/useMarketStore';
const { marketItems, buyItem, sellItem } = useMarketStore();
```

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Remove all MOCK_MARKET_ITEMS references
- [ ] Connect to useMarketStore for live data  
- [ ] Buy/sell actions update database
- [ ] UI shows loading states during transactions

### Task 2.0.2: Connect FinancialDashboard (🔴 Critical)
**Duration:** 2-3 days

**Current Issue:**
```typescript
// PROBLEM: Hardcoded financial data
const mockRevenue = 50000;
const mockExpenses = 30000;
```

**Required Fix:**
```typescript
// SOLUTION: Calculate from real game state
const revenue = calculateRevenue(routes, marketPrices);
const expenses = calculateExpenses(placedAssets);
```

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Remove all mock financial data
- [ ] Calculate revenue from actual active routes
- [ ] Calculate expenses from placed assets
- [ ] Show historical data from database

### Task 2.0.3: Connect RouteManager (🔴 Critical)
**Duration:** 2-3 days

**Current Issue:**
```typescript
// PROBLEM: Using mock routes
const MOCK_ROUTES = [...];
```

**Required Fix:**
```typescript
// SOLUTION: Use real route store
import { useRouteStore } from '@/store/useRouteStore';
const { routes, createRoute, deleteRoute } = useRouteStore();
```

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Remove MOCK_ROUTES constant
- [ ] Display routes from store.routes Map
- [ ] Connect CRUD operations to store
- [ ] Show actually assigned assets

### Task 2.0.4: Unify State Management (🟡 High)
**Duration:** 3-4 days

**Current Issue:**
- Multiple overlapping stores (empireStore, useMarketStore, useEconomyStore, useRouteStore)
- Data duplication between stores
- No clear hierarchy

**Required Fix:**
- Establish empireStore as root store
- Convert specialized stores to modules/slices
- Remove duplicate state variables

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Single source of truth for each data type
- [ ] Clear store hierarchy documented
- [ ] Cross-store subscriptions working
- [ ] No data duplication

### Task 2.0.5: Deprecate Legacy Asset Structure (🟡 High)
**Duration:** 1-2 days

**Current Issue:**
```typescript
// OLD: Type-specific asset objects
assets: {
  ships: Record<string, Ship>;
  planes: Record<string, Plane>;
}
```

**Required Fix:**
```typescript
// NEW: Unified asset system
placedAssets: Map<string, PlacedAsset>;
```

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Remove old asset structure from types
- [ ] Update all components to use placedAssets
- [ ] Update selectors (getAssetsByType, etc.)
- [ ] Create migration script if needed

## 🔍 Verification Checklist

After each integration task:

### Technical Verification
- [ ] **No Mock Data**: Search for "MOCK" in files - should find nothing
- [ ] **Store Connection**: Component imports and uses appropriate store
- [ ] **Database Persistence**: UI actions update Supabase database
- [ ] **No Console Errors**: Clean browser console
- [ ] **Real-time Updates**: UI reflects changes immediately

### Functional Verification  
- [ ] **Market Panel**: Shows live market items, prices update
- [ ] **Financial Dashboard**: Shows actual revenue/expenses from game state
- [ ] **Route Manager**: Displays real routes, can create/edit/delete
- [ ] **Asset System**: Uses unified placedAssets structure
- [ ] **State Management**: Single source of truth for all data

## ⚠️ Critical Development Rules

### 🚫 What NOT to Do
1. **Don't add new features** to components using mock data
2. **Don't create more mock data** - use real stores instead
3. **Don't duplicate state** between stores
4. **Don't skip integration testing** after each fix

### ✅ What TO Do
1. **Fix integration first** before any feature work
2. **Use single source of truth** for all data
3. **Test each component** after connecting to stores
4. **Document state relationships** as you build them

- [ ] Zero mock data in any production component
- [ ] All UI panels show live game state
- [ ] State changes persist to Supabase database
- [ ] No console errors or TypeScript warnings
- [ ] All components use unified state architecture

**Ready for Phase 2.5 When:**
- [ ] Market trading works end-to-end
- [ ] Financial calculations use real data
- [ ] Routes can be created and visualized
- [ ] Asset management is fully functional
- [ ] State management is consolidated and documented

## 🆘 Getting Help

**Immediate Blockers:**
- State management confusion → Check `docs/state-management.md`
- Integration errors → Use React DevTools + Zustand DevTools
- Database issues → Check `docs/database-schema.md`

**Daily Progress:**
- Update task status in this document
- Test each integration before moving to next
- Commit working changes frequently
- Document any new patterns discovered

Remember: **Integration before Innovation!** No new features until Phase 2.0 is complete.
