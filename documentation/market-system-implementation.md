- Price history tracking
- Market dynamics updates
- Player transaction history
- Default market initialization

### 3. Zustand Store (`/app/store/useMarketStore.ts`)
- State management for market data
- Dynamic price calculation formula
- Market cycle updates
- Buy/sell transaction handling
- Market trend analysis
- Real-time subscription support
- Persistent storage with Zustand persist

### 4. React Component (`/app/components/market/MarketPanel.tsx`)

- Price trend indicators (up/down/stable)
- Transaction validation
- Real-time price updates

### 5. Database Schema (`/supabase/migrations/005_market_system.sql`)
- `market_items` table with full market data
- `price_history` for tracking price changes
- `transactions` for recording trades
- `market_dynamics` for configurable market behavior
- Row Level Security policies
- Performance indexes
- Helper functions for price calculation

### 6. Edge Function (`/supabase/functions/update-market-cycle/`)
- Automated market updates every 60 seconds
- Supply/demand dynamics calculation
- Price volatility implementation
- Historical data cleanup

### 7. Demo Page (`/app/market-demo/page.tsx`)
- Fully functional market trading demo
- Player cash management
- Manual market update option
- Instructions and documentation

## Key Features Implemented

### Dynamic Pricing Formula
```
Price = (BaseCost + ProductionCostModifier) × (Demand / Supply) × (1 + VolatilityModifier)
```

### Market Dynamics
- **Supply Growth**: 2% per cycle default
- **Demand Volatility**: 15% random variation
- **Price Elasticity**: 1.2x factor
- **Seasonal Modifiers**: Spring/Summer/Fall/Winter variations

### Transaction System
- Buy at current market price
- Sell at 90% of market price
- Supply/demand adjustments post-transaction
- Transaction history tracking

### Market Categories
- **GOODS**: Raw Materials, Manufactured, Luxury, Perishable
- **CAPITAL**: Construction equipment, machinery
- **ASSETS**: Warehouses, real estate
- **LABOR**: Skilled workers, services

## Integration Points

### With Economy System
The MarketSystem is designed to integrate with the Economy Developer's profit calculations:
- Transaction costs affect player cash flow
- Market prices impact production costs
- Supply/demand drives economic cycles
- Price history enables economic analysis

### With UI System
- Responsive design for all screen sizes
- Real-time updates without page refresh
- Visual indicators for market trends
- Interactive trading interface

## Next Steps for Phase 2 Completion

1. **Economy Integration**
   - Connect market prices to production costs
   - Implement profit margin calculations
   - Add market-based revenue streams

2. **Asset Integration**
   - Allow asset trading in ASSETS market
   - Dynamic asset valuations
   - Asset-based collateral system

3. **Advanced Features**
   - Market predictions AI
   - Futures contracts
   - Market manipulation mechanics
   - Supply chain disruptions

## Usage Example

```typescript
// Initialize market
const marketStore = useMarketStore();
await marketStore.initializeMarket();

// Buy items
const transaction = await marketStore.buyItem(itemId, quantity, playerId);

// Check market trends
const { trend, percentageChange } = marketStore.getMarketTrends(itemId);

// Update market cycle (automated via Edge Function)
const updateResult = await marketStore.updateMarketCycle();
```

## Database Setup
Run the migration file to create all necessary tables:
```bash
supabase db push
```

Deploy the Edge Function for automated updates:
```bash
supabase functions deploy update-market-cycle
```

## Testing
Access the demo at `/market-demo` to test all market features with a simulated player account.
