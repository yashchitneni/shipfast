# Flexport Implementation Roadmap

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive, actionable roadmap for implementing the Flexport shipping empire game. Based on the strategic audit and development path forward, we've identified critical integration work that must be completed before new features can be added. The roadmap is structured into distinct phases with clear dependencies and measurable outcomes.

## Current State Assessment

### ‚úÖ Completed Components
- **Architecture**: Robust hybrid Next.js + Phaser.js structure
- **State Management**: Central Zustand store (empireStore.ts) with middleware
- **Backend**: Comprehensive Supabase schema (7 migrations)
- **Core Loop**: Purchase ‚Üí Create ‚Üí Assign ‚Üí Generate (partially functional)
- **UI Components**: Built but using mock data (needs integration)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Issues
1. **State Fragmentation**: Multiple stores without clear hierarchy
2. **Mock Data Dependency**: UI components disconnected from live data
3. **Incomplete Integration**: Bridges exist but aren't fully utilized
4. **Legacy Code**: Old asset structure still referenced in places

## Phase Breakdown

update(time: number, delta: number): void {
  const zoom = this.cameras.main.zoom;
  
  if (zoom >= 1.5) {
    // Show detailed port view
    const nearestPort = this.findPortAt(centerX, centerY);
    if (nearestPort) {

## Conclusion

This roadmap provides a clear path from the current fragmented state to a cohesive, engaging game. The highest priority is Phase 2.0 (Integration), which must be completed before any new features. Phase 2.5 (Dynamic Ports) directly addresses the most requested feature and will provide immediate value. Subsequent phases add depth and polish in a logical progression.

By following this roadmap, Flexport will transform from a collection of promising prototypes into a unified, strategic shipping empire game.
