### **Task 2.0.5: Deprecate Legacy Asset Structure** üü°
**Duration:** 1-2 days  
**Status:** Not Started

- [ ] Remove old assets: { ships: {}, planes: {} } structure
- [ ] Update all TypeScript interfaces
- [ ] Refactor components using old structure
- [ ] Use placedAssets Map exclusively
- [ ] Update all helper selectors
- [ ] Create migration script if needed

**Success Metrics:**
- Zero mock data in production
- All UI reflects live game state
- State changes persist to database
- No console errors or warnings

## **Development Guidelines**

### **Priorities:**
1. **Integration First** - No new features until Phase 2.0 complete
2. **Test Everything** - Each integration must be verified
3. **Document Changes** - Update docs as you go
4. **Performance Matters** - Monitor and optimize

### **Code Standards:**
- TypeScript strict mode
- ESLint compliance  
- Comprehensive testing
- Clear commit messages

### **Daily Workflow:**
1. Check current phase tasks
2. Update task status
3. Test integration thoroughly
4. Commit with clear message
5. Update documentation

## **Risk Management**

### **Technical Risks:**
- **State Sync Issues**: Mitigate with comprehensive testing
- **Performance Degradation**: Profile regularly, optimize early
- **Integration Complexity**: Take incremental approach

### **Schedule Risks:**
- **Phase 2.0 Overrun**: Critical path - allocate buffer time
- **Asset Creation**: Use placeholders, iterate later

---

## **Conclusion**

The project has strong foundations but requires immediate integration work. Phase 2.0 (Integration) is the absolute priority - no new features should be added until this technical debt is resolved. Once complete, Phase 2.5 (Dynamic Ports) will provide the most immediate value to gameplay.

This plan will be updated as phases complete and new requirements emerge.
